Tensorflow regression to predict fuel efficiencies for cars

Learning to predict Miles per gallon fuel averages for cars given their specifications: Horsepower, Weight, 
Displacement, Cylinders and make, year and model specifications

Tensorflow neural network model with 1-sequestial and 2-dense hidden layers tests with mean absolute error of 1.89 miles per gallon.
